# Main Ideas
## sonic clone
- endless runner inside a ring so the endless makes sense
- procedurally generated obstacles, three lanes to swap between to collect rings
- "superway speeders" (subway surfers joke...)
- MVP: just run and collect rings until you die
- More scope - on death, spend rings on upgrades (walk on water, jump, dash, spindash)
- Even more scope - eventually enough upgrades let you get to something that moves you to the next level (more lanes, bigger ring, new obstacles etc)
	 - OR Upgrades are found in-game one by one (jump is tough to get, water boots are up on ledge, dash is on water, spindash is behind huge gap you need dash jump for)
	 - maybe instead of new separate map rings, it's a ramp up to inner rings you can only get to with upgrades

- Obstacles are just trees and rocks and stuff
- scope creep: enemies that can be dashed through (angry face turns scared when you dash)
- Rings fall when you get hit, but stay there so you get them next run around (wait.. procedural means it can't.. maybe save procedural for a fancy later thing, for now just make level bespoke, make an editor?)


WebGL high priority (to put it on itch.io nicely)
android version?? lmfao no but forcing phone aspect ratio would be fuinny

## Art
- cheesy futuristic, neon stuff, maybe star fox lylat or corneria or whatever that city is, white greebled city
	- OR
	- cyberpunk dark, protag is car and you're on a highway
- in space?
