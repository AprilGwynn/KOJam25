## ~~Functional Anything:~~
- ~~camera inside map ring object that rotates~~
- ~~WebGL~~ 
## ~~control an object~~
- ~~set up unity controls to move character left and right with A and D, maybe mappable to controller?~~
## ~~snap to lanes, speed control~~
- ~~*as before, character stays put but ring stops and starts (with w and s for now)*~~
### collect rings
- ~~includes ring count hud~~
- ~~hitbox that increases ring count, disappear~~
- ~~*just stuck to map ring prefab*~~
- win state, collect 20 rings for "you win" modal
## attach objects to map ring nicely (dev tool)
## hurt by obstacles 
- includes health system, health bar hud
- hitboxes that reduce health but disappear for now
- rings now increase health
- fail state, you die and restart (modal)
## ring dropping
- hitting now slows "you" down, gradually regain speed
- invul timer
- rings drop on the ground to be picked up later
## Full playable map
- just a map with obstacles and rings placed around full thing, enough to win
==!!!!!MVP HERE ^ ^ plus maybe art pass)!!!!!!==
## art pass
- skinned mesh renderer protag OR car..
	- Anims:
		- running (circle legs)
		- damage
		- walking
	- juiced animation for hitting obstacle is maybe worth
- actual object(s) as obstacle
- scenery (clearly non-gameplay) like trees, to emphasize map ring
