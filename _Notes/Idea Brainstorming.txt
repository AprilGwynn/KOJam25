==Main Ideas==
-sonic clone-
endless runner inside a ring so the endless makes sense
procedurally generated obstacles, three lanes to swap between to collect rings
"superway sliders" (subway surfers joke...)
MVP: just run and collect rings until you die
More scope - on death, spend rings on upgrades (walk on water, jump, dash, spindash)
Even more scope - eventually enough upgrades let you get to something that moves you to the next level (more lanes, bigger ring, new obstacles etc)
OR
Upgrades are found in-game one by one (jump is tough to get, water boots are up on ledge, dash is on water, spindash is behind huge gap you need dash jump for)

Rings fall when you get hit, but stay there so you get them next run around (wait.. procedural means it can't.. maybe save procedural for a fancy later thing, for now just make level bespoke, make an editor?)
